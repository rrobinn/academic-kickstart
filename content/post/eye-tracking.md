Long before they can crawl or even pick up a toy, babies use their eyes to explore the world around them.  

I study how babies learn about other people, and how to interact with others. And since I can’t ask them questions about their thoughts of feelings, or have them participate in laboratory tasks, I use eye-tracking technology to figure out what’s going on inside their heads. 

# How it works
Think of the eye-tracker as a <i>very</i> high-speed camera. It sends out near-infrared light towards the infant, which then reflects off the pupil and cornea. These reflections are tracked by the camera so that we know where the baby is looking.

The eye-tracker that I use collects 300 samples a second. That means that we get a read-out of where baby is looking every 3.3ms. 

# What kinds of questions can we ask? 
It's all about connecting those eye movements to what the baby is looking at.

# What else can eye tracking be used for?  
You may have heard the phrase "the eyes are the windows to the soul." They're certainly a window to human cognition! Eye movements give us information about what catches our attention, how we explore our environments, and what information we use to guide decision making.  

Eye tracking is also being used in [PC gaming](https://help.tobii.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003295025-Eye-tracking-in-gaming-how-does-it-work-), and as [assistive technology](https://www.abilities.com/community/assistive_eye-control.html) to help with everyday computer use. s

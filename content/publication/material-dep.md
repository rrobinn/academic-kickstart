abstract = "Income, maternal education, and cumulative-risk indices of poverty-related adversity likely obscure meaningful heterogeneity in the mechanisms through which poverty impacts child outcomes. The present study draws from contemporary theory to specify multiple dimensions of poverty-related adversity, with the aim of better capturing these nuances. Using data from the Family Life Project (N=1,292), we leveraged moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA; Bauer, 2017) to establish group- and longitudinally-invariant measures of poverty-related adversity from infancy to early adolescence. Results indicated three latent factors—material deprivation, emotional threat, and sociocognitive stimulation—were distinct from each other and from family income. Each was largely invariant across site, race, and development and showed convergent and discriminate relations with age-twelve criterion measures. Implications for ensuring socioculturally-valid measurements of poverty are discussed."

abstract = "<b>Objective</b> To characterize restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) and reciprocal social behaviors (RSBs) in a large sample of toddlers who represent a range of birth weights and gestation durations. <b>Study design</b> A battery of questionnaires characterizing demographic information and measuring RRBs and RSBs were completed by parents of toddlers between the ages of 17-26 months (n = 1589 total; n = 98 preterm). The association between birth weight and/or gestation duration and the primary outcome measures (RRBs and RSBs as ascertained through the Repetitive Behavior Scale for Early Childhood and the Video-Referenced Rating of Reciprocal Social Behavior) were tested by using hierarchical multivariate multiple regression."

<caption align="bottom"> <b>Figure 5 from Sifre et al. (2018).</b> Distribution of low and high A, RBS-EC and C, vrRSB scores (as defined by below/above the sample mean), plotted as within-sample proportion for toddlers with low- and high-BPGD. Low BPGD was defined as being below the 50th percentile, while high BPGD was defined as >50th percentile. B, and D, show the relative proportion of toddlers with very low or high scores (as defined by below/above the 10th or 90th percentile) who are also below or above the 10th and 90th percentile for BPGD. </caption>

# Background  
An infant sits in daycare when she hears her mother’s voice. She immediately stops playing with her blocks, and a flurry of coordinated attention processes begin to coordinate in her brain. She must disengage from the enticing blocks, and search for her mother amidst a room filled with competing distractors. This seemingly simple behavior requires the recruitment – and the coordination of – multiple developing attention processes.

<i>Coordination</i> is the organization of different parts of a complex system that enable them to effectively work together. Coordination is essential to cognition but has been relatively understudied (Van Orden, et al., 2011). Research on attention is no exception. While we have a clear picture of the developmental timeline of each sub-component of attention, little is known about how these processes become coordinated.
